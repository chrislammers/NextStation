# NextStation App
This is a digital version of the game NextStation: London

Assets created by me.

## To Run:

In your console, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 basicScenario.py


## Notes:
requirements in requirements.txt

This code is incomplete. It is nowhere close to a finished product.


## In Developement: 
### 23/02/2025

the file "importMapData.py" is experimental code that pulls OSM data and aligns it to the game grid.

Eventually it will get blended in with the rest of the code, but for now acts as a standalone set of functions
